# Web Security Vulnerability Demonstrations

This project showcases common web security vulnerabilities, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks and Clickjacking, to help developers understand and prevent them.

## Features

### Demonstrated Vulnerabilities
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):**
  - `EvalAttack`: Demonstrates how using `eval()` with untrusted input can lead to security issues.
  - `UrlParamAttack`: Highlights the risks of directly using URL parameters without sanitization.
  - `DangerouslySetInnerHTMLAttack`: Shows how `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` can lead to XSS when processing untrusted user input.
  
- **Clickjacking:**
  - Demonstrates how malicious websites can use iframes to trick users into performing unintended actions.

### Safe Practices
The project includes examples of unsafe practices and recommendations for securing applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 14
- npm >= 6

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ershubhamgupta1/portfolio-web-security
   cd portfolio-web-security
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. **Access the app**:
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Security Recommendations
To prevent these security issues in a real-world application, here are some recommendations:

- Sanitize Inputs: Use libraries like DOMPurify to clean user inputs before rendering them in the DOM. 
-  Avoid eval: Do not use eval to execute code. It can execute any string of code, including malicious code.
-  Escape HTML: Always encode user inputs before rendering them in the DOM. This prevents injected HTML from executing as JavaScript.
- Content Security Policy (CSP): Configure CSP headers to restrict the execution of untrusted scripts and reduce the risk of XSS attacks.
- Clickjacking Protection: Use X-Frame-Options: DENY or Content-Security-Policy headers to prevent your pages from being embedded in iframes, thus mitigating clickjacking attacks.
